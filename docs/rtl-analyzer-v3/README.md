# RTL Migration Analyzer v3

Status: approved master plan. Documentation only; product implementation has not started.

RTL Migration Analyzer v3 is a self-contained, dark-first developer workspace for investigating RTL migration findings across a multi-application Nx monorepo. The primary workflow is:

`Workspace → scope → file → finding → verified source evidence → copy location`

## Approved decisions

- Keep one self-contained HTML output, with maintainable local CSS/JavaScript sources or templates bundled at build time.
- Add dashboard-only view-model versioning; schema-v2 remains unchanged.
- Treat application attribution as an overlapping set; global finding totals remain unique.
- Distinguish direct application findings, shared-library ownership, shared-library application impact, and unresolved reachability.
- Support English LTR and Arabic RTL UI. Paths, code, rule IDs, source text, and locations remain isolated LTR.
- Support Clipboard API plus a local-file-compatible fallback.
- Land on Code Explorer with deterministic initial finding selection when findings exist.
- Defer scan history, comparison, readiness percentages, progress tracking, and automatic fixes.
